2. There are a certain number of points in a particular sprint. All the points are divided into each developer and the goal of each developer is to complete the sprint points so that we can meet the goal of the sprint.
3. For communication, we use slack. As mentioned above, you should join the above slack channels.
4. For calls/meetings we use Zoom. You are encouraged to install the Zoom app on your laptop/desktop and login using your BSF Account.
